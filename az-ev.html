        <p class="project-pg-desc">A mailer & website that provide legal information for evictees in the state of Arizona. They are part of a non-profit research study. The goal of the website is to make housing court accessible to tenants, so they know their rights and options. It has three main sections: Find Your Case Info, Identify Defenses & Counterclaims, and Create Court Documents. Each section asks the user questions to provide only the information that is relevant to their case while filling out relevant forms that the user can later download. This structure & flow was set up by the team at Stanford's Legal Design Lab. I was brought in through the Creative Resilience Collective for visual design for both the mailer and website and to work through the nuances of the UX.</p>

            <p class="project-pg-desc">Part of the process for this project involved a user-testing workshop organized by Stanford’s Legal Design Lab. People who have been through the eviction process were brought in to review rough designs and content so that we could get a better idea of what’s most helpful & encouraging. The printouts pictured are rough designs for the mailers.</p>
