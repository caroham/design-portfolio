                <p class="project-pg-desc fade-in">A mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to remind users to reach out to contacts who they haven't talked to in a while. The reminders are based on how frequently a user normally talks with each contact, and notifies users when they fall out of their normal communication cycle. A beta version of the app was formerly on the Google Play store but has been taken off.</p>

                    <h3 class="challenge-title proj-h3">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="challenge-text project-pg-desc">We chose to emphasize specific pieces of the information we had, such as the frequency of communication, how many days it has been since last contact, and the best time to reach out (based on when the specific contact most often responded to the user). One of my suggestions was to simplify the actions by displaying the most common method of contact as the main action button, rather than showing all text/call/video chat options, along with 2nd-level buttons to choose another method of contact, snooze the reminder to reach out, and to hide the contact. This creates a clear primary action based on the user’s behavior pattern so the user has less decisions to make and is more likely to act on a reminder to reach out.</p>
