                        <p class="challenge-text">We ended up with several solutions to provide the user information no matter how much of the flow they’ve completed. I proposed a persistent collapsible section where, once expanded, users can see an overview of the documents they have started filling out. Users have the option to download those documents before they’ve finished the full flow, as well as blank documents if they don’t want to fill them out online. The Stanford team proposed creating “Basic Guide” PDF’s with all of the general information that can be downloaded right away for people who don’t want to go through the question flow at all.</p>

For instance, the printouts pictured above are wireframe-like rough designs for the mailers. The visuals were intentionally kept rough and sketch-like so that the focus was more on the content and general layout rather than the details of the design. I separately prepared stylistic options for the illustrations, pictured below.</p>
