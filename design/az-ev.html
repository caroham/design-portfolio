                <h3 class="desc-title proj-h3 fade-in">Description</h3>
                <p class="project-pg-desc fade-in">A mailer & website that provide legal information for evictees in the state of Arizona. The project is part of a non-profit research study to see if providing information in a more accessible way will resort in more court appearences by evictees and more cases successfully defended. The website has three main sections: Find Your Case Info, Identify Defenses & Counterclaims, and Create Court Documents. Each section asks the user questions to provide only the information that is relevant to their case while filling out relevant forms that the user can later download. This structure & flow was set up by the team at Stanford's Legal Design Lab. I was brought in through the Creative Resilience Collective for visual design for both the mailer and website and to work through the nuances of the UX.</p>

                    <p class="challenge-text project-pg-desc">How do we strike the right balance of getting a user's information that is specific to their case while also providing information for users who don’t have the time or are too impatient to get through all of the flows?</p>
                    <h3 class="challenge-title proj-h3">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="challenge-text project-pg-desc">We ended up with several solutions to provide the user information no matter how much of the flow they’ve completed. I proposed a persistent collapsible section where, once expanded, users can see an overview of the documents they have started filling out. Users have the option to download those documents before they’ve finished the full flow, as well as blank documents if they don’t want to fill them out online. The Stanford team proposed creating “Basic Guide” PDF’s with all of the general information that can be downloaded right away for people who don’t want to go through the question flow at all.</p>
